Data exploration is the first step of data analysis used to explore and visualize data to uncover insights from the start or identify areas or patterns to dig into more. Using interactive dashboards and point-and-click data exploration, users can better understand the bigger picture and get to insights faster. This is the first and very basic project of a Data Analyst's Portfolio.
A raw Dataset in the form of A Excel file is downloaded and cleaned using Microsoft Excel. Later the data is loaded into the newly created Database in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Later the records are explored with the help of SQL Programing Language.
After exploring the data using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, the data is imported to Microsoft PowerBI Desktop. The data is played with graphs, charts and map visualizations. A simple report is generated and exported as a PDF file for further data analysis.
